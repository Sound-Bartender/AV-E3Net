batch items should have same shape
Feature concatenation in GS-fusion block. Shapes missmatch
Shufflenet is for image classification, need to take features without the last fc layer
find_unused_parameters=True in DDP constructor. unused parameters in shufflenet and lstm block(typo)

shufflenet normalize, input size 224
loss function too close to zero.

AO vs AV compare vs Naive AV
chunk input for real-time 160=10ms=4frames (640 = 40ms = 1 video frame) samples 1 frame
Different SNR
dataset is too complicated
new dataset with interfering speakers
add images in BA (input waveform -> input features -> mask -> applied mask -> out features -> output waveform)
add audios to github and write about it in ba

BA structure:

\section{Introduction}

tell story, non-technical

0. General introduction
1. Audio-only with limitations
2. AV SE benefits Video importance
3. AV-SE in real time on CPU
ADD structure of BA
